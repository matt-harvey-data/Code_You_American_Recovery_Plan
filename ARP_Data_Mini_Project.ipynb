      "Nearly $6 million in marketing for downtown is a hard no from this resident. I love downtown, was down there yesterday in fact. The Convention and Visitors Bureau is more than capable of handling this for far less than $6 million. Our city has proved time and time again to be incapable of addressing real needs downtown, let's start with housing the homeless instead of criminalizing them. Let's stop giving away millions of dollars to giant corporation 4th Street Live, the Omni. Let's stop assuming marketing downtown means convincing wealthy east end residents to visit, no amount of marketing is going to change the majority of their minds. Make downtown a place people want to be and we will come, marketing is not the problem. Remove cars, incentivize development of surface lots, subsidize popular local businesses to come downtown, do away with all the one-way streets. This kind of thing has been done all over the world, and right across the river. It's not rocket science and it's not marketing. Create a place people want to be and go and they will come, putting up banners, creating a tag line, and airing a commercial isn't the way to invest these dollars.      1\n",
